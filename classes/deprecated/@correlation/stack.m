function c = stack(c,varargin)

% c = STACK(c)
% This function appends a stacked waveform to the end of the correlation
% object. Stacking is performed with the traces aligned on their trigger
% times (as they appear in plots). In order to do this traces must be
% cropped to the same time interval relative to the triggers. This is most
% easily accomplished using the CROP function prior to STACK. If the traces
% have not been cropped, STACK will attempt to figure out which time window
% of data should be stacked. This may or may not be in the user's best
% interest. Caveat Emptor!
%
% c = STACK(c,INDEX)
% Same as above except the stack is only performed using a subset of the
% traces as specified by the index numbers, INDEX.
%
% The traces are summed, but not normalized or averaged. In order
% to be stacked, the "phase shift" of the samples within the trace must be
% the same. If it is not, STACK will make a call to ALIGN to resample all
% traces such that one sample falls directly on the trigger time. Following
% the convention of waveform, the trace time and name are based on the
% first trace that contributed to the stack.
% 
% ** NOTE TO USERS: Though most plotting routines normalize adjacent traces
% to comparable amplitudes for display, the real trace amplitudes often
% very by orders of magnitudes. Depending on the features the user is
% trying to highlight, it may make sense to normalize the trace amplitudes
% before stacking. This can be performed with the NORM function.
