function A = mtimes(A, B)
   %MTIMES (*) Overloaded Matrix multiply for waveforms (UNIMPLEMENTED!).
   %     X*Y is the matrix product of X and Y.  Any scalar (a 1-by-1 matrix)
   %     may multiply anything.  Otherwise, the number of columns of X must
   %     equal the number of rows of Y.
   %
   %     C = MTIMES(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A * B' when A or B is an
   %     object.
   %
   %     Currently, for all practical purposes this is the same as A .* B
   %     But this part could change...
   %
   %     See also TIMES, MTIMES.
