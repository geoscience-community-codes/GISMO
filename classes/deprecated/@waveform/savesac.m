function w = savesac(w, direc, fname)
   %SAVESAC  creates a SAC file from a waveform
   % savesac(waveform)   saves a waveform to a sac file in the
   % current directory, with a default filename as described below.
   %
   % savesac(waveform, directory)  saves the  sac file in the
   % provided directory, but with default filenames as described below.
   %
   % savesac(waveform, directory, filename)   saves a sac file
   % based upon the waveform(s).  The number of filenames (given as CELLS)
   % must equal the number of waveform objects to save.
   %
   % If filename is left out, a default filename will be generated for each
   % SAC file.  The default name will be
   %   YYYYMMDD_HHmmss.STATION.CHANNEL.NETWORK
   %   if the network does not exist in the waveform (in User defined field
   %   KNETWK, which is the standard SAC field for this), then network as
   %   defined in the filename becomes '__';
   %   For example:
   %    for waveform COLA(BHZ) starting 1/5/2007 04:03:21.32 ,AK network -->
   %       20070105_040321.COLA.BHZ.AK
   %    for waveform COLA(BHZ) starting 1/5/2007 04:03:21.32 ,no network -->
   %       20070105_040321.COLA.BHZ.__
   %
   % w = savesac(w...) will add history to the waveform showing into which
   % file the waveform was written.
   %
   % The waveform object is parsed out and placed into the sac header, with
   % the following equivalent fields set.  That is, the SAC field is replaced
   % with the waveform based values.
   % _waveform_ 	_sac_
   % STATION		KSTNM
   % CHANNEL		KCMPNM
   % FREQUENCY		1 / DELTA (ODELTA is not used)
   % START			NZYEAR, NZJDAY, NZHOUR, NZMIN, NZSEC, NZMSEC
   % UNITS			IDEP (but with caveats.  See SAC header info from llanl)
   %
   %
   % savesac uses routines developed by Mike Thorn and modified by yours
   % truly,  stored in the @waveform/private/ directory.
   %
   % For more information about the SAC header, and the interpretation of the
   % fields, check out Lawrence Livermore's web site.  Search for "seismic
   % sac" and you'll find it.
