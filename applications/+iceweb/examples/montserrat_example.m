%% Running IceWeb on directory tree of Miniseed files
% In my research groups in Alaska and now Florida, we always tended to
% organize datasets into Antelope CSS3.0 databases. The advantage of this
% is that Antelope then handles all the heavy lifting of loading files,
% which can be in SEED, Miniseed or SAC format, filling gaps, and crossing
% file boundaries. And it does so very efficiently because the Antelope
% programs are compiled C code. 
%
% However, most of the datasets we get directly from instruments are
% directory trees of miniseed data. Until now, GISMO has never had a way to
% easily navigate these directory trees. But now that it does, we have an
% alternative to the having to using miniseed2db to build a wfdisc table.
% This is useful because we do not always have Antelope available, and
% because a wfdisc table often requires directory paths and filenames to be
% shortened. Also, we no longer have to write our own wrappers to navigate
% complex directory structures, as we previously had to to avoid using
% Antelope.
%
% To get a first look at data, however it is structured, it is useful to 
% work through the data in timewindows of 10 minutes to 1 hour, and compute
% RSAM data and make spectrograms. This is what "IceWeb" does. This name
% goes back to a system written at UAFGI/AVO in 1998 that made these sorts
% of plots with real-time data from the AVO seismic network.
%
% Welcome to the first example of running IceWeb on a collection of
% Miniseed files!
